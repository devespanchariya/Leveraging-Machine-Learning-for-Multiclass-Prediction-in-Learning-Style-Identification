# Leveraging-Machine-Learning-for-Multiclass-Prediction-in-Learning-Style-Identification

This research demonstrates a machine learning approach to automatically predict students’ learning styles from academic usage behaviors and self-reported dispositions. Learning styles across visual/verbal, sensing/intuitive, active/reflective and sequential/global dimensions were modeled based on a multifaceted dataset of 1000 university learners. Five supervised classifiers – Random Forests, Support Vector Machines, Decision Trees, Gradient Boosting and Naïve Bayes – were developed and optimized for accurately categorizing individual preferences. Additionally, an integrated ensemble model was tested for maximizing precision. Results show predictive accuracy surpassing prior efforts, achieving 87% averaged across styles. Random Forests emerged as the optimal stand-alone algorithm while the ensemble classifier outperformed individual techniques. Analysis of predicted distributions provided adaptive learning planning insights regarding cohorts and minorities. Large-scale trials of personalized interventions based on assigned learner schema showed improvements in satisfaction, retention and performance relative to default modes. The research confirms the viability of data-driven machine learning techniques to unlock personalized education at scale to benefit diverse needs. Findings support the accountable development of analytics-driven platforms leveraging predictive modeling under responsible governance to democratize learning access.
